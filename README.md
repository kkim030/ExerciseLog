***Phase 4 Task 2***
- Sample of events:
  Event added to Profile.
  Event added to Profile.
  Event deleted from Profile.

***Phase 4 Task 3***
- The association between Profile and DayLog could have been bidirectional.
- The project could have been improved so that the data saved is not reset when a new name is entered but 
multiple accounts could be created for more realistic use.
- According to Single Responsibility Principle, one method should serve one function but for EventLogAdd Classâ€™ 
actionSave(), the method not only saves but also instantiates the next frame pop up and disposes the current frame. 
Such functions should have been divided.
